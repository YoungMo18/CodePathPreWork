<b>App Idea: </b>
* An app idea that I've always wanted to create is a polaroid camera app. I've always loved polaroid cameras and their vintage style, so to have one on my phone would be convinient. Instead of carrying a polaroid camera everywhere, I will always have one in my pocket (my phone). Some features this app would have is taking photos, have a variety of polaroid-esque filters, save photos in camera roll, and the ability to print these photos on polaroid paper to replicate what you get from a physical camera. The UI of this app will resemble a polaroid camera. The colors will be warm and playful to symbolise the nostalgia and good memories you get from a polaroid camera. Lastly, to take photos, there would be an option to set it as the volume-up button, to imitate the shutter buttons from physical cameras.
